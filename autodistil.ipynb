    "# AutoDistil\n",
    "This notebook covers the use of [Roboflow's autodistillation](https://blog.roboflow.com/autodistill/) feature.\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "Model distillation is a technique for compressing a large model into a smaller model. The smaller model is trained to mimic the behavior of the larger model. This is useful for deploying models to devices with limited memory and processing power, such as mobile phones and embedded devices. What *Autodistill* aims to do is to automate the processes of training a computer vision model using initially unlabeled data. Instead autodistill uses a large model trained on a large dataset to label the unlabeled data. The labeled data is then used to train a smaller model which can be deployed to edge devices.\n",
    "## Setup\n",
    "### Install Dependencies\n",
    "This notebook utilizes the pre-trained [SAM-Segment Anything Model](https://segment-anything.com), [[Github]](https://github.com/facebookresearch/segment-anything) [[Paper]](https://ai.facebook.com/research/publications/segment-anything/), and [Grounded Dino](https://huggingface.co/spaces/ShilongLiu/Grounding_DINO_demo), [[Github]](https://github.com/IDEA-Research/GroundingDINO) \\& [[paper]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.05499.pdf) models. The following are the dependencies needed to run this notebook:\n",
    "- [AutoDistill](https://github.com/autodistill)\n",
    "- [autodistill-grounded-sam](https://github.com/autodistill)\n",
    "- [autodistill-yolov8](https://github.com/autodistill/autodistill-yolov8)\n",
    "- [supervision](https://github.com/autodistill/supervision)\n",
    "- **optionally** [autodistill-sam-clip](https://github.com/autodistill/autodistill-sam-clip)\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many available base-models, i.e. grounded-sam or sam-clip, that can be used to label the unlabeled data. Make sure to use the one that works best for your use case. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Note** do not label all of your unlabeled data at once. Instead test if the model works well on a small subset of your data before labeling all of it. It might help to test a different base-model if the first one does not work well. See the [autodistill repo](https://github.com/autodistill) for the latest updates on available base-models.\n",
    "\n",
    "To install the dependencies run the following commands:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "pip install autodistill autodistill-grounded-sam autodistill-yolov8 supervision\n",
    "```\n",
    "It is recommended to use a virtual environment to install the dependencies.\n",
    "\n",
    "With the environment setup, we start the auto-distillation process by importing the necessary libraries."
